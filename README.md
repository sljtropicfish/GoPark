How to run localhost?
1. After you download and unzip the file, you may need to install the dependencies accordingly, you can find them in the package.json file. 
2. You may need to set up your own mangodb (NoSQL database) locally if you want to make the user login/logout functions work. Or you can mock a DB or use any other type of database as long as you feel comfortable with it. 
3. If you do not set up a DB, it is still possible to run it, just ignore all the warnings; and of course, you cannot login/logout. 
4. Once you are ready to run, type "node app.js" (without the quotation marks) on the terminal and hit enter.
5. On a browser, type in address: http://localhost:3000/, you should be able to see the website.
